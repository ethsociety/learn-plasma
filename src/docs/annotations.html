                    The
                    <a href="https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf" target="_blank">white paper</a>
                    written by Joseph Poon and Vitalik Buterin has spurred a large wave of innovation, but it has equally created confusion
                    on many topics. One year later, Plasma has slightly departed from its original proposed specs, having now a rather
                    expansive definition, with several different proposed implementations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be revealing to briefly describe the recent history of Plasma, as it rolled out
                    over the last year.
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-plasma/426" target="_blank">Minimum Viable Plasma</a>
                    was initially proposed as a model adhering to most of the procedures outlined in the white paper, but it turned out that
                    some parts, such as the multi-step process of state transitions, could be dramatically improved. Shortly after,
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-plasma-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1298" target="_blank">Plasma Cash</a>
                    did it by the means of non-fungible tokens, enabling simple, reliable and low-cost transactions. It is in particular applicable
                    to high throughput but low or medium-state applications, like micropayments and exchanges. Other notable examples include
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-debit-arbitrary-denomination-payments-in-plasma-cash/2198" target="_blank"></a>
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-xt-plasma-cash-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1926" target="_blank"></a>
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/more-viable-plasma/2160" target="_blank"></a>
                    each one of them deriving from one of the first two models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to this amalgam of implementations, it may not be crystal clear what Plasma in and of
                    itself represents. That is why we wanted to dedicate an entire page to annotate the confusing parts in the white paper
                    and draw a separation line between what is being built and what not.

                <h4 id="mapreduce">MapReduce</h4>
                <p>
                    MapReduce is a general-purpose framework for parallelizing computations over a cluster of machines. Within the context of Plasma,
                    it was proposed as the de facto computing paradigm, being mentioned 14 times in the white paper. Chapter 2.4 begins with the belief
                    that blockchain is to git what Plasma is to MapReduce:
                </p>
                <p class="blockquote-se">
                    blockchain : git :: Plasma : Hadoop (MapReduce)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plasma was initially conceptualised as a design pattern to encompass complex computations into blockchains. It was achieving that
                    by spawning a theoretically infinite number of chains under a hierarchical model, where input data is mapped,
                    computed by children chains and then combined and sent to parents. Proper incentives were mandated to ensure correctness.
                    From page 10:
                </p>
                <p class="blockquote-se">
                    We propose a method whereby the map phase includes commitments on data to computation
                    as input, and in the reduce step includes a merkleized proof of state transition
                    when returning the result. The merkleized state transition is enforced via fraud proofs
                    constructed on the root blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as Plasma is concerned, MapReduce is not a focus of active research or development anymore. The community now
                    considers Plasma a general framework for designing second-level chains which inherit the security of the main, public chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One doesn't have to specifically use MapReduce to "map" and "reduce" the data inputs and outputs, respectively.
                    Furthermore, one doesn't even have to mind having children chains in the first place, when the second-level chain is enough
                    for doing the work necessary in that arbitrary context (e.g. a low-volume decentralized exchange).
                </p>

                <p>
                    As pre-empted in the previous section, there hasn't been much effort invested in developing nested chains on Plasma,
                    that is, chains modeled under a hierarchical tree. Chapter 2.2, "Enforcible Blockchains in Blockchains",
                    and chapter 6, "Blockchains in Blockchains, describe a methodology for this:
                </p>
                <p class="blockquote-se">
                    Instead, we construct a system of higher and lower courts where particular venues can
                    exist to prove state. One can view the root blockchain as the Supreme Court from which
                    the power of all subordinate courts derive their power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the philosophy of considering the root chain a supreme court remains, it turns out that merely developing a functional
                    Layer 2 blockchain is a non-trivial task in itself. In particular, it is hard to get exit transactions right, because the incentives to not
                    follow the rules and redeem more funds are really high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, a notable exception is
                    <a href="https://loomx.io" target="_blank">Loom</a>,
                    which have developed the so-called "DAppChains", blockchains easy to spawn using an SDK. They can use alternative consensus rulesets,
                    such as Delegated Proof of Stake,
