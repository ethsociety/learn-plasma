                    <a href="https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf" target="_blank">white paper</a>
                    written by Joseph Poon and Vitalik Buterin spurred a large wave of innovation, but it equally created confusion
                    on many topics. One year later, Plasma slightly departed from its original proposed vision, having now a rather
                    expansive definition, with several different proposed implementations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be revealing to briefly describe the recent history of Plasma, as it rolled out
                    over the last year.
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-plasma/426" target="_blank">Minimum Viable Plasma</a>
                    was introduced as a model adhering to most of the procedures outlined in the white paper, but it turned out that
                    some parts, such as the multi-step process of state transitions, could be dramatically improved. Shortly after,
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-plasma-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1298" target="_blank">Plasma Cash</a>
                    did just that by the means of non-fungible tokens, enabling simple, reliable and low-cost transactions. It is in particular applicable
                    to high throughput but low or medium-state applications, like micropayments and exchanges. Other notable examples include
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-debit-arbitrary-denomination-payments-in-plasma-cash/2198" target="_blank">Plasma Debit</a>,

                    and
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/more-viable-plasma/2160" target="_blank">More Viable Plasma</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to this amalgam of implementations, it may not be crystal clear what Plasma in and of
                    itself represents. That is why we wanted to dedicate an entire page to annotate the confusing parts in the white paper
                    and draw a separation line between what is being built and what not.

                <h4 id="mapreduce">MapReduce</h4>
                <p>
                    MapReduce is a general-purpose framework for parallelizing computations over a cluster of machines. Within the context of Plasma,
                    it was proposed as the de facto computing paradigm, being mentioned 14 times in the white paper. Chapter 2.4 opens with the idea
                    that Plasma is to MapReduce what blockchain is to git.
                </p>
                <!--<p class="blockquote-se">-->
                    <!--blockchain : git :: Plasma : Hadoop (MapReduce)-->
                <!--</p>-->
                <p>
                    Plasma was initially conceptualised as a design pattern to encompass complex computations into blockchains. It was aiming to
                    achieve that by spawning a theoretically infinite number of chains under a hierarchical model, where input data is mapped,
                    computed by children chains and then combined and sent to parents. Proper incentives were mandated to ensure correctness.
                    From page 10:
                </p>
                <p class="blockquote-se">
                    We propose a method whereby the map phase includes commitments on data to computation
                    as input, and in the reduce step includes a merkleized proof of state transition
                    when returning the result. The merkleized state transition is enforced via fraud proofs
                    constructed on the root blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as Plasma is concerned, MapReduce is not a focus of active research or development anymore. The community now
                    considers Plasma a general framework for designing second-level chains which inherit the security of a public,
                    secure root chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One doesn't have to specifically use MapReduce to &quot;map&quot; and &quot;reduce&quot; the data inputs and outputs, respectively.
                    Furthermore, one doesn't even have to mind having children chains in the first place, when the second-level
                    chain might be enough for doing the work necessary in that arbitrary context (e.g. a low-volume decentralized exchange).
                </p>

                <p>
                    As pre-empted in the previous section, there hasn't been much effort invested in developing nested chains on Plasma,
                    that is, chains modeled under a hierarchical tree. Chapter 2.2, &quot;Enforcible Blockchains in Blockchains&quot;,
                    and chapter 6, &quot;Blockchains in Blockchains&quot;, describe a methodology for this:
                </p>
                <p class="blockquote-se">
                    Instead, we construct a system of higher and lower courts where particular venues can
                    exist to prove state. One can view the root blockchain as the Supreme Court from which
                    the power of all subordinate courts derive their power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the philosophy of considering the root chain a supreme court remains, it turns out that merely developing a functional
                    Layer 2 blockchain is a non-trivial task in itself. In particular, it is hard to get exit transactions perfectly entangled,
                    as the incentives to not follow the rules and redeem more funds are exceptionally high. Models for designing
                    nested chains will most likely start popping out in the near future.

                    or Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge,
                    are frequently referenced in the white paper. Chapter 4.6 is entirely dedicated to the topic:
                </p>
                <p class="blockquote-se">
                    Non-interactive proofs of computation allow for one to have significant benefits in scalable
                    computation... There has already been research in SNARKs for MapReduce
                    functionality and we hope this leverages on that research and Plasma extends it
                    by making the proofs orderable and enforcible within a set of blockchains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    zkSNARKs, especially recursive ones, could make state transitions on Plasma (e.g. deposits
                    or withdrawals) significantly more lightweight in time and memory consumption. However, as argued in this
                    <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-plasma-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1298/13" target="_blank">thread</a>,
                    the root chain would require knowledge of the trusted zkSNARK setup made by the Plasma chain operator (something not really
                    desirable). Moreover, due to not being lossless, zero knowledge proofs don't even hold enough
                    information to design a secure exit challenge game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, heavy academic research is being conducted on zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs. We may see improvements on the
                    status-quo over the next few years, improvements which may spur novel Plasmatic designs.

                <p>
                    The following is a list of elements and concepts which would benefit from being appended brief additional clarifications.
                </p>

                <hr class="hr-dash my-2">
                <h6 id="rootchain">Root Chain</h6>
                <p>
                    As Plasma is a design pattern, not a product, the root chain could theoretically be any blockchain
                    which allows the creation of smart contracts. Indeed, most projects working on Plasma chose Ethereum to be
                    their root chain, but that's merely a matter of preference.
                </p>

                <hr class="hr-dash my-2">
                <h6>UTXOs vs Accounts</h6>
                <p>
                    Most examples given in the white paper presume a UTXO model, but that's only because of inferred simplicity. Latest
                    thought debates, in particular within Plasma Debit, yielded heuristics closer to an account-based model
                    than an UTXO-based one.
                </p>

                <hr class="hr-dash my-2">
                <h6>Bitmaps</h6>
                <p>
                    It wasn't never truly clear what these bitmaps are. Key-value pairs, where the keys map to the balances on the
                    root chain contract and the values are binary?
