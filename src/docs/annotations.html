                <p>
                    Before we try to explain what Plasma <i>is</i>, we should first understand <i>why</i> Plasma exists.
                    This is going to be a relatively high-level overview and will try to avoid going into a lot of detail, but it should set the stage for the rest of this website.
                    Basically, it boils down to the fact that current blockchain systems are pretty slow by modern standards.
                    To handle even simple payments in any widespread capacity, blockchains would need to process something on the order of a few thousand transactions per second.
                    Ethereum can currently only support 20-30 transactions per second at a max depending on network conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This discrepancy between what already exists and what needs to exist is generally called the “<b>blockchain scalability</b>” problem, and it’s not an easy problem to solve!
                    We want to scale blockchain systems, but we also want to make sure we scale in a way that preserves security and decentralization.
                    After all, that’s why we started building blockchains in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Projects are tackling the scalability problem in lots of different ways.
                    Some of these projects are attempting to make blockchains more scalable by upgrading the blockchains themselves.
                    We often call this “layer 1” scaling because we’re modifying the base layer.
                    Other projects are trying to build things on <i>top</i> of existing systems.
                    We usually refer to this as “layer 2” scaling because we’re adding a new layer and not changing the underlying system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plasma fits into this second category of “layer 2” scaling projects.
                    It’s important to understand how layer 2 projects tend to work and what they’re trying to accomplish.
                    Many layer 2 designs come from the observation that it’s not necessary for everyone to know about every transaction that occurs on the network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s think about this for a second.
                    Imagine you buy a coffee from your local coffee shop every morning.
                    Besides the fact that that’s a lot of coffee and you should definitely cut down, you might eventually notice that it’s easier to pay if you use the shop’s prepaid mobile wallet.
                    You load money into the wallet once and you don’t have to pull out your wallet every time.
                    It’s also faster and cheaper for the merchant because they don’t have to go through a payment processor every time.
                    It’s a win-win for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we break this down, we can see that we’re basically putting money into a local “ledger” that you maintain with the coffee shop, almost like a prepaid tab.
                    We’ve made everything easier because there’s no reason to let the rest of the world know that you’ve made a payment to the coffee shop.
                    As long as you and the shop agree about your current balance, everything is easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this is really at the core of most layer 2 projects.
                    The above example is quite simple - it only involves two participants (you and the coffee shop).
                    However, people wanted to see if we could extend that idea to entire blockchains.
                    Would it be possible to transfer money from one blockchain to smaller (and cheaper) blockchain temporarily, move the money around on the second chain, and eventually transfer money back?
                    Turns out, it is!
                    Here’s where we start to see the evolution of “sidechains.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic idea here is that we can take assets from one chain and transfer them to another (called the “sidechain") by locking the assets up on the primary chain (or “root chain”) and “creating” them again on the sidechain.
                    When you want to go back, you simply need to “destroy” the asset on the sidechain and unlock them on the root chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This sounds pretty simple, but there’s one big catch - someone has to agree to “create” those assets on the sidechain.
                    So who gets to “create” the assets?
                    Well, the consensus mechanism, basically.
                    The idea here is that if the sidechain consensus mechanism is functioning properly, then your assets are safe.
                    Unfortunately, the sidechain is usually much less safe than the root chain.
                    If someone manages to create money “out of nowhere” that doesn’t correspond to assets being locked up on the root chain, they can “destroy” these assets (that they fraudulently created) and steal lots of money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously this isn’t ideal.
                    As long as the sidechain is safe, your assets are safe.
                    But if the sidechain ever breaks down, then your assets might be stolen! Here’s where we introduce Plasma.
                    Plasma was first developed as a way to get some of the benefits of sidechains while ensuring that the assets stored on the sidechain are always safe (as long as the root chain is safe).
                    We don’t get <i>all</i> of the utility of sidechains, but we preserve some of the most important things (like being able to make transactions cheaply) while also maintaining security.
                    The fundamental principle of Plasma is that all user assets can always “fall back” to the root chain in the event of a security failure on the sidechain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why we need Plasma.
                    Blockchains are slow and expensive.
                    We want to make blockchains fast and cheap, but we don’t want to sacrifice safety.
                    If you’re ready to learn about how we get the best of both worlds, keep reading!
