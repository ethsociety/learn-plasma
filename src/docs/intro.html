            <p>
              If you ended up here, you’re probably interested in learning about Plasma, a framework for building scalable decentralized applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started LearnPlasma because the existing information about Plasma is spread all over the place.
              We wanted to gather all of that information in a single place and make it much easier for someone to browse.
              At the same time, we found that there simply isn’t enough easy-to-understand learning material about Plasma.
              We started writing our own material and eventually we ended up here!
            </p>

              LearnPlasma is a community effort and a labor of love!
              The project was started at the <a href="http://www.initc3.org/events/2017-07-13-IC3-Ethereum-Crypto-Boot-Camp-at-Cornell-University.html" target="_blank">2018 IC3-Ethereum Crypto Boot Camp at Cornell University</a>.
              Most of the content on this website was contributed by people who didn’t know anything about Plasma coming into the boot camp.

            <p>
              Learning alone is no fun!
              To make the learning process as collaborative as possible, we’ve launched the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnplasma/" target="_blank">LearnPlasma reddit community</a>.
              There you’ll be able to ask questions and discuss different Plasma-related topics with other people also learning more about Plasma.
              You can also tweet at the <a href="https://twitter.com/learnplasma" target="_blank">LearnPlasma Twitter account</a> if you’d like to.

            <h3 id="nontechnical">A non technical explanation of Plasma</h3>
            <p>
            Blockchains are very useful because they allow peers to safely interact with one another, without the need for any sort of central authority. In a decentralised system, like a blockchain, there is no central computer or central storage system. Instead, every piece of information, in relation to the blockchain’s operation, has to be instantly published and then stored separately by each peer.
            This, and other factors, limit the scalability of blockchain systems, and as such, blockchains can only process a handful of transactions per second. As a result, what’s known as, second layer scaling solutions are being researched and developed. These second layer solutions, like Plasma, can be created independently and then run on-top of the blockchain. 
            </p>
            <p>
            As we just mentioned, decentralised systems require that everybody stores everything. But what if you just wanted to send a token to your local coffee shop twice a day? Does everybody really need to know about that in real-time?
            Second layer solutions allow you to take transactions off the blockchain, whilst still enjoying the safe operation and security offered by the core blockchain system. This sounds like magic, how is this achieved? There are quite a few cryptography functions and crypto-economic mechanisms which can help with this. This area of development is under heavy research and development. It may be the case that different types of Plasma implementations will better serve different types of situations. We have already seen a few different designs such as Minimal Viable Plasma, Plasma Cash, Plasma Debit, More Viable Plasma and so forth. It is likely that there will be separate application specific implementations of Plasma.
            An important thing to remember is that Plasma is not one product, it could perhaps be better described as an abstract idea, or proposal, which has since spurred a lot of interest in taking blockchain scaling to a whole new level.
            </p>
