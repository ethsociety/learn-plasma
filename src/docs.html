            <p class="lead-2">Get familiar with Plasma, a framework for building scalable blockchain applications.</p>


            <hr class="hr-dash my-7">


            <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
            <p>Plasma is a proposed framework for incentivized and enforced execution of smart contracts which is scalable to a significant amount of state updates per second (potentially billions) enabling the blockchain to be able to represent a significant amount of decentralized financial applications worldwide.</p>

            <hr class="hr-dash my-7">

            <h3 id="goals">Design goals</h3>
            <p>In order to implement plasma effectively, there are certain design goals that need to be met. Let’s go through those goals and the significance of each.</p>

            <h5>#1 One Blockchain to rule them all</h5>
            <p>As stated earlier, the main blockchain will be the root blockchain and every other child chain will be derived directly or indirectly from it. The root chain will not interfere with any of the child chains except on the event of disputes.</p>

            <h5>#2 Minimization of Trust</h5>
            <p>The system needs to be as trustless as possible. None of the child chains can be completely dependent on the ethics of certain actors. There should be mechanisms for someone to exit from the child chains..</p>

            <h5>#3 Ledger Scalability</h5>
            <p>The blockchains should be able to hold a lot of data. The child chains should be able to take up the data that would normally go on the root chain.</p>

            <h5>#4 Should be Scalable</h5>
            <p>The child chain should be compatible with various scaling solutions. Basically, they should be capable of implementing solutions like sharding and lightning network as well.</p>

            <h5>#5 Localized Computations</h5>
            <p>Each child chain must be capable of doing their own calculations. On regular intervals, each chain should give their state updates to the parent chain.</p>

            <h5>#6 Fraud Proofs</h5>
            <p>On the event of a dispute, the bereaved party can send a proof of fraud to the root chain The root chain can then roll back the state of the child chain and penalize the signers of the block of the child chain.</p>

            <h5>#7 Every Plasma Chain is Unique</h5>
            <p>Every child chain can have its own governance rules. They can be their own unique entity as long as they are constantly reporting back to the main chain.</p>

            <hr class="hr-dash my-7">


            <h3 id="settlement">Root chain settlement</h3>
            <p>The root chain is like the universal absolute ground truth, while the child chains work around it doing their own computations and periodically feeding state information to the root chain.</p>
            <p>The root chain comes into play only when there is a dispute that needs to be settled in the child chain, otherwise, it doesn’t involve itself with anything going on in the child chain and this point is the core underlying philosophy behind it. If the root chain is going to be the ground truth, then it must remain as devoid of activity and calculations as possible.</p>


            <hr class="hr-dash my-7">

            <p>Here's some notes to know how our navbar works, before getting deeper into it.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Most of the basics can be find in the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/" target="blank">official documentation of navbar</a> component. It's highly recommended to get start from there.</li>
              <li>Our color scheme classes works inverse of the Bootstrap definition. For example, <code>.navbar-dark</code> makes the text dark colored and <code>.navbar-light</code> makes the colors lighter.</li>
              <li>You can have a different color scheme for the navbar once it's stick at the top by adding one of the <code>.navbar-stick-dark</code> or <code>.navbar-stick-light</code> classes.</li>
              <li>Inside the <em>.navbar-brand</em>, you can specify two logos; <code>.logo-dark</code> to display for <em>.navbar-dark</em>; and <code>.logo-light</code> to be display with <em>.navbar-light</em>.</li>
              <li>
                You should set the placement of navbar using <code>data-navbar</code> attribute. It can has one of the following values:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>static</code>: Only at top, don't move with scroll.</li>
                  <li><code>fixed</code>: Always at top of the screen and moves with scrolling down.</li>
                  <li><code>sticky</code>: First at top, hides after a small scroll down, so it won't obscure the header. Once the user scrolls down and passes the header, navbar become fixed/sticky at the top again.</li>
                  <li><code>smart</code>: It's like sticky navbar, but it only becomes sticky when the visitor scrolls up.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Our template adds few classes to the body tag to detect when the scrollbar passed an element which is to use by CSS. Those classes are <code>.body-scrolled</code>, <code>.navbar-scrolled</code> and <code>.header-scrolled</code></li>
              <li>In mobile devices, the content inside <code>.navbar-mobile</code> will display to the user.</li>
              <li>We have defined few utility classes to make your coding easier for different situations. Those classes can categorized into <code>.d-mobile-*</code> —change display value on mobile devices— and <code>.d-stick-*</code> —when the navbar sticks to the top— which <strong>*</strong> can be one of the <code>none</code> | <code>block</code> | <code>inline-block</code> | <code>flex</code> | <code>inline-flex</code> values. So <code>.d-stick-none</code> will hide an element when the navbar has sticked at the top.</li>
            </ul>
