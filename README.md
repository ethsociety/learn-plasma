# Learn Plasma

[LearnPlasma](https://www.learnplasma.org/) is a resource for information about [the Plasma framework](http://plasma.io/). 

## Goals
- Allow users to understand the motivation and benefits of Plasma scalability frameworks.
- Allow users to easily find and explore content.
- Provide an in-depth exploration of every aspect of Plasma.
- Clarify confusing concepts or terminology to better explain Plasma.
- Create short, canonical documentation for key Plasma concepts.
- Encourage community Plasma research and implementation.

## Audience
The primary goal of LearnPlasma is to facilitate an open ecosystem of research on blockchain scalability through Plasma frameworks. Plasma research combines technical development and cryptoeconomic incentive and mechanism design. 

LearnPlasma should be a starting point, a way for developers, researchers and economists to catch up on the latest state of Plasma research and gain deeper understanding of the challenges and objectives. As well as a means for developers of decentralized applications to better understand when a Plasma chain is optimal for their scalability needs and use cases. The primary audience of LearnPlasma is therefore *developers and economists interested in understanding Plasma*. Although we can assume some general technical background, documentation should *assume that the reader has no prior Plasma knowledge*.
