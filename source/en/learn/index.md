## Introduction
If you ended up here, you're probably interested in learning about Plasma, a framework for building scalable decentralized applications.

We started LearnPlasma because the existing information about Plasma is spread all over the place.
We wanted to gather all of that information in a single place and make it much easier for someone to browse.
At the same time, we found that there simply isn't enough easy-to-understand learning material about Plasma.
We started writing our own material and eventually we ended up here!

### Contributing
LearnPlasma is a community effort and a labor of love!
The project was started at the [2018 IC3-Ethereum Crypto Boot Camp at Cornell University](http://www.initc3.org/events/2017-07-13-IC3-Ethereum-Crypto-Boot-Camp-at-Cornell-University.html).
Most of the content on this website was contributed by people who didn't know anything about Plasma coming into that boot camp.

You can also become a contributor to LearnPlasma!
There's always lots to be done.
This entire website is open source and available at the [LearnPlasma GitHub](https://github.com/ethsociety/plasma-website) repository.
Please open a GitHub issue if you're confused about something, want to ask a question, or have any general feedback!
Want to see content about a specific topic? Open an issue!
If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, we've created a [simple guide to opening your first issue](/en/resources#contributing).
We also appreciate any pull requests with bug reports, typos, or new content.

If you want to contribute code to a Plasma project, we're maintaining [a list of actively developed Plasma implementations and ecosystem projects](/en/build).
You can also learn about the current open research questions and see a list of ways you can contribute [here](/en/research).

### Community
Learning alone is no fun!
To make the learning process as collaborative as possible, we've launched the [LearnPlasma reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnplasma/).
There you'll be able to ask questions and discuss different Plasma-related topics with other people also learning more about Plasma.
You can also tweet at the [LearnPlasma Twitter account](https://twitter.com/learnplasma) if you'd like to.

We're looking for subreddit moderators!
Feel free to reach out to any of the current moderators if you'd like to help out.
